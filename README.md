## üåΩ Overview

*For generations, the Barnett family has protected their town from the Darkness that lies beneath their farmlands. Every year on Hallow's Eve, the Darkness grasps for freedom.*

*You are the last of the Barnett family line, and the time has come once more. Not even the moon is here to guide you through the winding fields of the Barnett estate. Can you fend off the rising evil, or will your bloodline die here..?* <br /> <br />
